##Terraform refactor issue
- The gitpod automatic installation of terraform was not working so to resolve the issue new installation code has been copied form the terraform docs.
- The new file of with the name of **install_terraform_cli** contains the code for terraform installtion.
- Also a few changed has been made in the gitpod yaml file. The main issue was with the init command which has been replaced with the before command.
